1. Head over to your alertimizer dashboard.
2. From the navigation menu select **Reports** tab.
3. From the drop down menu select **Down Time Report**.
4. Choose the **website alias** for which you want to view the down time report.
5. This will give you an up to date graph of the down time of your website.
6. Every time the graph shows a point coinciding with the x axis of the graph is the time when your website was found to be offline.
